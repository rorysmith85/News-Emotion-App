      <h2>What's Going On?</h2>
      <p>This app allows you to look at the top five headlines - as they relate to a specific subject, i.e. Syria or Brexit - from two different news sources and
      contrast the dominant emotion and sentiment found in each grouping.</p>
      <p>For anyone interested in studying news bias or how emotion and sentiment perfuses the news,
      this app allows you a peek beneath the surface.</p>
      <p>Given that most people get their news from the headlines, and not from the actual story,
      understanding how headlines pander to our human emotions and sentiments is important.</p>
      <p>The numbers under Avg Emotion and Avg Sentiment accord to the average scores of emotion and sentiment of the top five headlines
      shown below.</p>
      <p>Sometimes there are two different emotions that show up, which may seem contradictory, such
      as joy and sadness. When the app produces two different emotions it means that joy and sadness
      shared the same average within the analysis, and, as such, both are shown.</p>

      <h2>How the App Works</h2>
      <p>The vivisector uses three APIs - one news agglomerator, and two different
      language analysis APIs, for emotion and sentiment respectively.</p>
      <p>While far from perfect in terms of anaylzing sentiment and emotion - most of
      these natural language analyzers aren't necessarily rigorous - they give us
      an idea of the dominant emotions and sentiments within the headlines.</p>
      <p>The app then takes your input, i.e. news sources and your subject of interest,
      gathers the top five headlines from your chosen news sources, and related to your subject
      of interest, then uses the two text analysis APIs to vet the emotions and sentiment within each block.</p>
      <p>You are thus able to see if there are any patterns or differences in sentiment
      and emotion with regards to the news source from which the headlines emanate.</p>

      <h2>Emotion</h2>
      <p>The emotion is chosen from five different emotions: anger, joy, fear,
       sadness, and surprise.</p>
       <p>The chosen emotion, or the emotion that appears on your screen, is the emotion
       that had the highest probability of being in the headlines.</p>
       <h2>Sentiment</h2>
       <p>The sentiment ranges from very negative to very positive with neutral meaning little to no sentiment.</p>
